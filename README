This is a clone of tetris made using Qt. 
controls:
Space to start game. 
left/right for moving blocks left and right
up key for rotating blocks.

KNOWN BUGS:

rotation of a block by the side will cause a crash due to the rotation placing 
blocks out of bounds. this is being worked on. 

Info: 
Tetris is a game first written in 1984. It is one of the best known games ever
made and is fairly easy to implement.
This clone makes use of the Qt graphics API to produce the GUI and for drawing. 
Unlike many Qt projects, this clone makes no direct use of qmake, instead using
the CMake system for maximum cross platform compatibility.
